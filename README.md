  Welcome to my API
</h1>

## Description

This project is for studying purposes and is still a work in progress using **Nest.js and PostgreSQL**, so the idea of this probject is an API Rest where you register, login and create your character, each character will have 6 attributes wich are: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. Those attributes are going to be deffined by rolling 6d20 (6, 20 sided die) and the user will distribute each result for each attribute the way he or she wants, the user can roll the dice if they have one or use any other dice roller or just use a function of the own API to roll it.
